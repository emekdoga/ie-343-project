Question 1:
Facility Count : 5
Point Count : 20
CPU time : <1ms

Facility Count : 10
Point Count : 40
CPU time : <1ms

Facility Count : 50
Point Count : 100
CPU time : <20ms

Facility Count : 200
Point Count : 400
CPU time : <880ms

Facility Count : 400
Point Count : 800
CPU time : <20754ms

When the dimension of the problem increases, time spent on iterating greedy algorithm increases.


Addedc Functions :
FindCandidateFacilities -> Find unused facilities to determine candidates
FindBestCandidate -> Find best candidate among possible choices using greedy algorithm
CalculateGreedyCost -> To calculate point distance to closest facility in given facility set
